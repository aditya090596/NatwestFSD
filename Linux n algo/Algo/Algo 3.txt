Write an algorithm to calculate the total bill amount of the products you purchased.
        Display the final amout after adding 10% GST on total amount and deducting the discount amount
        if total price is greater than 1000 then discunt is 5%
        if total price is greater than 3000 then discunt is 10%
        if total price is greater than 5000 then discunt is 15%

        GST will be added after discounted amount deducted

        Step 1: Start
        Step 2:  Items list
                 Item  1 
                 Item  2
                 Item  3
                 Item  4
        Step 3: Sum  of all the items ( Item 1+ Item 2+Item 3+Item 4)
        Steps 4 : Display total amount " X"
                 If total > 1000 then  discunt is 5%
                 Amount after discount " P "        
                 10 % GST of total + Amount after discount " 10% of X + P"
                
                 If total > 3000 then  discunt is 10%
                  Amount after discount "Q " 
                  10 % GST of total + Amount after discount "10% of X + Q "

                  If total > 5000 then  discunt is 15%
                 Amount after discount " R"        
                 10 % GST of total + Amount after discount " 10% of X + R"
                 Final amount =  (Discounted amount + 10 % GST of X) 
        Step 6: To pay = " Z" 
        Step 7: Stop
